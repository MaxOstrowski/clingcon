What is the exact relation between grounding atoms/literals and solver literals (n to 1 I assume)

- shouldn't I always use solver literals ?
- how to create new ASPIF rules (backend) with solver literals?
- I assume that grounding atoms/literals and solver literals share the same DataType but are actually different
- use C++ API clingo.hh
- Domains:
  Should I still use domains with holes
   Holes:
   - can represent (x=2y) without constraints (needs buggy equality processing)
   - can represent small domains and is needed for some initial propagation using facts
   No Holes:
   - faster lookup, no binary search, easier implementation
  FAZIT: Use old classes with Holes, afterwards compare with optimized version without holes.
- think about faster propagation, saving current lower/upper bound and only add changes
- think about linear constraints with conditions!
- createOrderClauses, currently i can translate contraints but do not create order clauses,
  this is still done with propagator
- replace ~l with -l, otherwise we do bitwise inverse on literals instead of negation

First I need to do grounding.
Than I can access the backend, to modify the ground program.
I can access the theoryAtoms via Clingo::Control::theory_atoms()
Then I need to modify the program/do completion, add new theory atoms via the backend.
I have to do this outside the propagator (at least not during the init call)


What about solver_literal from PropagateInit
All datastructures are created using aspif literals,
    on init I have to convert all of them to solver_literals


    Printing:
    Currently outside of propagator on solve() method,
    no functionality like json

Facts: Simple facts like domain predicates can not be detected as true,
  as the grounder does not have any feature like this. So &dom{0..1} = x. can not be detected
  and an unbounded variable is created.
