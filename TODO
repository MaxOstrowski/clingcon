TODO:
 - find out whether two linear constraint exclude each other
   e.g. a<b and b<a, bound propagation has problems with this
 - remove magic numbers
 - add a difference logic propagator
 - have a drink

KNOWN_BUGS:
 - library for python/lua support is called clingo (not clingcon)
 - preground incremental programs do not work
