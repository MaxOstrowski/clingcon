TODO:
 - add test s.isChoice() for transformHeadRules, remove these rules and add :- a, not a.
 - make <csp.lp> an internal file
 - make windows binary
 - find out whether two linear constraint exclude each other
   e.g. a<b and b<a, bound propagation has problems with this
   - subset relations like x+y<=7 and x+y <=9 and  x+y+z<=c can maybe be exploited
 - remove magic numbers
 - add a difference logic propagator

KNOWN_BUGS:
 - library for python/lua support is called clingo (not clingcon)
 - sometimes variable solutions are printed multiple times,
   if using var(5) and var(6-1) in the encoding
