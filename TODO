TODO:
 - make <csp.lp> an internal file
 - clingo version 5.1.0 is written on every startup, maybe change or add clingcon
 - make windows binary
 - find out whether two linear constraint exclude each other
   e.g. a<b and b<a, bound propagation has problems with this
   - subset relations like x+y<=7 and x+y <=9 and  x+y+z<=c can maybe be exploited
 - remove magic numbers
 - add a difference logic propagator

KNOWN_BUGS:
 - library for python/lua support is called clingo (not clingcon)
